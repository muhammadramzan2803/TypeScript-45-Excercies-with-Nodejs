// Q 20 Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, 
// rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list 
// containing these items.
// Making a Programming Languages Array
var programmingLanguages = ["Typesscript", "Javascript", "Python", "PHP"];
// Print the message of List
console.log("List of Programming Languages:");
// Print the Values of Array in the from of List
programmingLanguages.forEach(function (language) { return console.log(language); });
